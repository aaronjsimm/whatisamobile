    <h2 class="what">What the <span>heck</span> is a Mobile?</h2>
    <p class="definition">A mobile is a type of kinetic sculpture constructed to take advantage of the principle of equilibrium. It consists of a number of rods, from which weighted objects or further rods hang. The objects hanging from the rods
      balance each other, so that the rods remain more or less horizontal. Each rod hangs from only one string, which gives it freedom to rotate about the string. An ensemble of these balanced parts hang freely in space, by design without coming
      into contact with each other.</p>

    <h3>Mobiles Are For Everyone!</h3>
    <p class="startext">The meaning of the term "mobile" as applied to sculpture has evolved since it was first suggested by Marcel Duchamp in 1931 to describe the early, mechanized creations of Alexander Calder. At this point, "mobile" was
      synonymous with the term "kinetic art", describing sculptural works in which motion is a defining property.</p>

    <h3 class="evil">Even Babies Love Mobiles!</h3>
    <p class="moontext">Mobiles are popular in the nursery, where they hang over cribs to give infants entertainment and visual stimulation. Mobiles have inspired many composers, including Morton Feldman and Earle Brown who were inspired by
      Alexander Calder's mobiles to create mobile-like indeterminate pieces.</p>

    <h3>Mobiles Are the Next Big Thing!</h3>
    <p class="suntext">By the sequential attachment of additional objects, the final creation consists of many balanced parts joined by lengths of wire whose individual elements are capable of moving independently or as a whole when prompted by air
      movement or direct contact. Thus, "mobile" has become a more well-defined term with its origin in the many such hanging constructs Calder produced.</p>
